Exercise 1
	Scenario 1
		1. Because the step size in bytes is equal to cache size in bytes.
		2. Never change. Because ever loop's ine the cache block is change so the hit rate is not change.
		3. Change step size to 1. Or change array size to 32.

	Scenario 2
		1. 2. lw and sw
		2. miss hit hit hit. Because every address access twice and the cache block size is 16 and the step size is 8 in bytes.
		3. Because the hit/miss pattern is answer 2, so the hit rate is 3/4 equal to 75%. 
		4. The hit rate is close to 100%. Because the total cache can have 256 bytes equal to array size, so the by on loop, the array is in cache, the next loop is all hit.
		5. address, access, address, adress. (the main point is separate block)

	Scenario 3
		1. L1 50%. L2 0%. total 50%
		2. 32 total. 16 missea.
		3. 16 total. all misses.(if L1 miss, that access L2)
		4. Change the repcount. Because the L2 total is equal to array. Only one loop that can all stored in L2. but L1 is the half of array size.
		5. The hit rate of L1 is increase(if the repcount is more than 2). the L2 is always 0%.

Exercise 3
	Part 1
		blocksize = 20, n = 100: 
		blocksize = 20, n = 1000: 
		blocksize = 20, n = 2000: 
		blocksize = 20, n = 5000: 
		blocksize = 20, n = 10000: 

		1.
		2.

	Part 2
		blocksize = 50, n = 10000:
		blocksize = 100, n = 10000:
		blocksize = 500, n = 10000:
		blocksize = 1000, n = 10000:
		blocksize = 5000, n = 10000:

		1.
